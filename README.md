# House-Price-Prediction-using-data-science
House Price Prediction is a classic and practical Data Science project that uses regression techniques to estimate the market value of houses based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on various input features using machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“– Theory / Concept:
House price prediction is a regression problem in machine learning, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (price) based on independent variables (features like square footage, number of rooms, location, etc.).

Common Algorithms:
Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost

Gradient Boosting Regressor

ðŸ“Š Sample Dataset:
You can use:

Kaggleâ€™s House Prices Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

or create your own .csv file with sample features.

ðŸ§  Workflow:
Load the dataset

Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers)

Feature Engineering (encoding, scaling)

Split the dataset into training and test sets

Train the model

Predict house prices

Evaluate model accuracy
